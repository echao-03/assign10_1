- get_ingredient()
	- Returns integer of total amount of ingredients.

- set_ingredient()
	- Takes in two arguments of ingredient and amount of ingredients given.

- get_drinktypes()
	- Prints out different types of drinks and required ingredients for them.

- create_coffee()
	- Returns output of created drink, takes in one argument of what drink the user wants to create. If the desired drink does not have the required ingredients, print out error message.
- turn_power()
	- Boolean statement, returns True if power is on, returns False if power is off. Power must be on to create the different drinks.

Demo Program Documentation
--------------------------

The demo program is a user-inputted program that allows the user to fully use the classes and the methods in it. 
It also makes it easier for the user as it creates a simulated program of a Coffee Machine with changing values, instead of running the program over and over.
You do not need to install any modules or files for this program.


To run the demo program, run the program in Window Terminal. After that, follow the printed instructions to input any options of your choice.
